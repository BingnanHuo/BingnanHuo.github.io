  This research project developed an automated system for diagnosing and grading the severity of Facial Nerve Paralysis (FNP) using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system achieved over 80% accuracy in grading FNP severity by processing facial images. We implemented image processing techniques to standardize unstructured data and trained multiple machine learning models including Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost, with comprehensive cross-validation for performance evaluation.

summary: First Place Best Poster Award - Computer vision and machine learning approach for automated grading of facial nerve paralysis severity.

## Overview

This undergraduate research project focused on developing an automated system for diagnosing Facial Nerve Paralysis (FNP) using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The work resulted in a Python-based backend that achieved over 80% accuracy in grading FNP severity.

### Key Contributions:
- Developed image processing pipeline for standardizing unstructured facial image data
- Implemented data augmentation techniques for improved model training
- Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost)
- Created a comprehensive cross-validation framework for performance evaluation

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy for data processing
- OpenCV for image processing
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- scikit-learn for machine learning models

The project was awarded First Place Best Poster at the 2022 Susquehanna Valley Undergraduate Research Symposium.

### Repository Structure
