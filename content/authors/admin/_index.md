## About Me

## About Me

Hi! I am Bingnan Huo (ÈúçÁßâÊ•†), a masters student in Data Science at Brown University. I am a member of the [Intelligent Robotics Lab](http://irl.cs.brown.edu/), led by [Prof. George Konidaris](https://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/), where I conduct research on reinforcement learning and robotics. My current work focuses on option generalization under the Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework, aiming to develop reusable skills for robotic applications.

I have contributed to multiple research projects, including a paper submitted to ICLR 2025 on learning transferable subgoals, and I'm currently leading a project on applying these concepts to robotic motion planning using the Franka Emika Panda robot. Previously, I worked on medical image processing using computer vision and machine learning at Bucknell University, where I developed a system for diagnosing Facial Nerve Paralysis with over 80% accuracy.

My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning, and robotics, with a particular focus on developing AI systems that can learn and adapt to solve complex real-world tasks. I am passionate about bridging the gap between theoretical advances in AI and practical applications in robotics.
