      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi! I am Bingnan Huo (霍秉楠), a masters student at Brown University. 
I am a part of the [Intelligent Robotics Lab](http://irl.cs.brown.edu/), led by [Prof. George Konidaris](https://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/), which conducts research on reinforcement learning, planning, and robotics.
I am interested in building AI systems that learn and solve complex tasks in the real world, with reinforcement learning and robotics
My research interests include artificla intelligence, reinforcement learning, and robotics.  Bingnan is passionate about using reinforcement learning to solve real-world problems and improve people's lives.
