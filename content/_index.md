  # RESEARCH OVERVIEW

      title: 'ðŸ¤– Research Overview'
      subtitle: ''

        I am a masters student in Data Science at Brown University, where I am part of the [Intelligent Robotics Lab](http://irl.cs.brown.edu/) led by [Prof. George Konidaris](https://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/). My research focuses on developing intelligent robotic systems that can learn and adapt to solve complex real-world tasks.

        Currently, I am working on:
        - Option generalization under Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework for learning reusable robotic skills
        - Applying transferable subgoals with motion planning for skill generalization across tasks using the Franka Emika Panda robot
        - Developing novel approaches for learning transferable subgoals as option termination classifiers (ICLR 2025 submission)

        Previously at Bucknell University, I worked on medical image processing using computer vision and machine learning, developing a system for diagnosing Facial Nerve Paralysis with over 80% accuracy.

        I am actively seeking collaborations in reinforcement learning, robotics, and AI. Feel free to reach out! ðŸ“«
